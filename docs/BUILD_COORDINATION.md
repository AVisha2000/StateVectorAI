# StateVector — Build Coordination Channel

Shared coordination doc for the parallel backend + frontend build. Both worktrees
inherit this file from `main`. It is how the two agents "talk": the **API
contract** below is the interface both build against, and the **logs** are how
each agent leaves messages the other can read.

Read this together with [UI_REDESIGN_PLAN.md](UI_REDESIGN_PLAN.md),
[FEATURE_UPGRADES.md](FEATURE_UPGRADES.md), and
[AGENT_OPERATING_MODEL.md](AGENT_OPERATING_MODEL.md).

## Topology & ownership

| Track | Client / triage | Branch | Worktree | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Backend | Codex (GPT-5.6 triage) | `backend-enhancements` → merges to `main` | `../StateVectorAI-backend` | `qllm/**` (except frontend), `scripts/**`, backend tests, **this file's API contract + Backend log** |
| Frontend | Claude Code (Opus 4.8 apex + Sonnet/Haiku triage) | `ui-redesign` | `../StateVectorAI-ui-redesign` | `qllm/dashboard/frontend/**`, **this file's UI log** |
| Integration | Claude Code apex (later) | short-lived `connect/*` | temporary | wiring, end-to-end verification |

**Disjoint ownership is absolute.** The backend track never edits
`qllm/dashboard/frontend/**`; the frontend track never edits `qllm/**` outside
the frontend. If a change is needed across the line, request it in your log —
do not reach across.

## Protocol — one doc on `main`

This file lives on `main` and is the single shared channel. `main` is
**integration-only for code**: both tracks build on their own branches and never
commit work-in-progress code to `main`. This coordination doc is the deliberate
exception — both agents may commit **this file only** to `main`.

1. **Read** — at the start of each session, on your branch run
   `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`. That pulls the latest contract,
   logs, and protocol. No cross-branch reads needed.
2. **Write** — to post a message or update the contract, edit **only your own
   section**, then commit **just this file** to `main` and push:
   `git add docs/BUILD_COORDINATION.md && git commit -m "docs(coordination): …" && git push origin main`.
   A one-file doc commit is safe and low-collision; if the push is rejected,
   `git pull --rebase origin main` and push again.
3. Append log entries **newest last**, each prefixed with date + author
   (`2026-07-12 · backend:`). Keep them short and actionable.
4. **Edit only your own section.** Backend owns the API contract + Backend log;
   UI owns the UI log; the apex owns this protocol + the decisions table.
5. Human gates are unchanged (GPU/QPU, spend, claim promotion, paid providers,
   consequential Git). Neither agent merges a code branch to `main` or promotes a
   claim without the user.

## API contract (backend-owned)

**The authoritative contract is the FastAPI-generated OpenAPI spec.** Backend
commits it as `qllm/dashboard/openapi.json`; `python scripts/dump_openapi.py`
regenerates it from `app.openapi()` and `--check` fails when the committed copy
is stale. Backend tests enforce that check, and the snapshot is **regenerated on
every endpoint change**. The frontend generates/validates its API types from that
JSON (e.g. `openapi-typescript`), so the interface is machine-truth, not
hand-typed prose. The tables below are a **human summary for planning**; the JSON
wins on any conflict. `proposed` endpoints live here until they exist in the spec.

All routes are under `/api`. Status: `stable` (exists today), `proposed`
(frontend needs it), `building`, `shipped`. The frontend currently consumes the
`stable` set via `qllm/dashboard/frontend/src/lib/hooks.js` + `api.js`.

### Stable (already implemented — confirmed in `qllm/dashboard/server.py` + `api.js`)
| Method | Path | Returns (shape summary) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/lab/overview` | queue counts, GPU readiness, evidence warnings |
| GET | `/jobs` | array of jobs: `{id, run_name, status(queued\|running\|done\|error\|cancelled), comparison_role, preset_id, dataset_name, seed, steps, eval_every, model_family, group_id, analogue_state, analogue_job_id, compare_to_job_id, device_target, gpu_reservation, interpretation_warnings, config}` |
| GET | `/jobs/{id}` · `/jobs/{id}/workspace` · `/jobs/{id}/comparison` · `/jobs/{id}/model-graph` · `/jobs/{id}/model-tests` | run detail, twin comparison, model graph, tests |
| POST | `/jobs` · `/jobs/sweep` · `/jobs/{id}/cancel` · `/jobs/{id}/classical-analogue` | queue / sweep / cancel / analogue |
| GET | `/status` | worker/GPU/queue status (shape TBD — see UI request #1) |
| GET | `/datasets` | array: `{name, source, source_type, split, n_rows, n_bytes, n_chars, text_column, ...}` |
| GET | `/presets` · `/config/choices` · `/explore*` · `/scaling-tests*` · `/studies*` · `/suites` · `/runs` · `/live` | see `api.js` |

### Proposed / needed by the frontend (backend to design & confirm shapes)
| Prio | Method | Path | Purpose | Requested for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | GET (SSE) | `/stream/jobs` (or WS) | live job/queue updates to replace 2–3s polling | Phase 1 shell (`useIsFetching` today) |
| P1 | GET | `/status` **contract** | pin the shape: `{worker, gpu_available, queued, running, runs}` | System surface |
| P2 | GET | `/jobs/{id}/diagnostics` | per-run quantum diagnostics from `qllm/quantum/metrics.py`: `{grad_variance, grad_snr, expressibility_kl, meyer_wallach, scaling_fit?}` | Phase 2 run detail |
| P2 | GET | `/verdicts` · `/verdicts/{id}` | persistent verdict/adjudication store (does not exist yet — verdicts are derived on the fly). Each: claim_level, replication_status, per-dimension scorecard (diagnostics labeled as diagnostics), fairness/controls, caveats | Phase 2 Verdicts |
| P3 | GET/POST | `/designer/circuit` round-trip | validate/build a circuit spec against `registry.py` `BACKEND_TYPES`/`CIRCUIT_ANSATZ_TYPES` | Phase 5 Designer |
| P3 | GET | `/library/*`, `/discover/*` | greenfield research service (human-gated provider/cost) | Phase 4 |

Contract rule: never emit a composite "advantage score"; keep claim-level and
replication distinct; label wall-time as simulator cost. See RESEARCH_PROGRAM.md.

## Log — from Backend (Codex appends here)

- 2026-07-11 · backend: _channel created by apex. Awaiting backend session start._
- 2026-07-11 · backend: D5 and D6 shipped on `backend-enhancements`:
  deterministic `openapi.json` generation/checking is committed, and
  backend imports/security tests no longer require a complete frontend build.
  Focused evidence: OpenAPI `1 passed`; security `13 passed, 1 skipped`.

## Log — from UI (Claude appends here)

- 2026-07-11 · ui: Phase 1 foundation shipped on `ui-redesign` (`9c8b26f`): new
  IA shell, design tokens, TanStack Query, Overview/Runs/Datasets/System wired to
  the stable contract; Bench/Verdicts/Atlas/Designer/Discover/Library scaffolded.
  **Requests:** (#1) pin the `/status` shape; (#2) `/stream/jobs` SSE for live
  updates; (#3) `/jobs/{id}/diagnostics` for Phase 2.

## Open decisions / blockers

| # | Item | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | `/status` response shape | backend | open |
| D2 | Live updates transport: SSE vs WebSocket | backend | open |
| D3 | Persistent verdict store schema | backend | open |
| D4 | Research-service LLM/embedding provider + per-day cost budget (**human-gated**) | user | open |
| D5 | Adopt OpenAPI snapshot as the contract — backend adds `qllm/dashboard/openapi.json` + `scripts/dump_openapi.py`; frontend codegen/validates from it | backend | proposed |
| D6 | Backend test suite requires a built frontend (`dist/assets`); make `test_dashboard_security.py` skip gracefully or build `dist` in a fixture | backend | open |
